Make My Password
================
This is a simple add-on that will, when you ask it, create a password for you by
randomly pulling from a string of characters.

How to Use It
-------------
Right-click on a password field and select _Create Password_ from the menu.

Additional Features
-------------------
After you create a password, it will be automatically copied to your clipboard.
That way, if, for example, you use an external password manager, you can save
your new password in it right away.

Can I Save the Password in Firefox?
-----------------------------------
Sure! After the password is created and you submit the form, Firefox should ask
you if you want it to remember the password. Tell it, "yes."

Customizations
--------------
There are several preferences that you can set from the Add-ons Manager:

- Password length
- Characters to use in the password
- How long the clipboard should contain the new password
  (It will reset to its original contents after the specified number of seconds.)
